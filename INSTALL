1. Background

	Rwrite is a program package that allows users to send short
	text messages to other users through the network.  Rwrite
	conforms the RWP-message transfer protocol described in
	RFC-1756.

2. Requirements

	Rwrite needs an UNIX-like system with ANSI-compatible
	C-compiler and reasonably BSD-like network libraries.

3. Installation procedure

	- Unpack the software package.

	- Configure with `./configure'.  If you don't have an user 
	  group that owns all the logged tty devices, we suggest that
	  you create a group `rwrite' to protect incoming message logs
	  of the users and reconfigure.

	- Compile with `make'.

	- Install with `make install'.

	- Update your /etc/services -file (see. services.add).

	- Update your /etc/inetd.conf -file (see. inetd.conf.add).

	- Make /etc/rwrite.conf -file for your system
	  (see. sample-etc-rwrite.conf and sample-dot-rwriterc).

	- Enjoy.
